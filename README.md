# Complex Analysis

Definitions:

***Riemann Mapping Theorem***: Let D be a simply connected proper subset of ℂ; z0 a point in D; and U = {w:|w| < 1} the unit disk in the w-plane. 
There exists exactly one conformal mapping f:z → w = f(z) from D onto U that satisfies f(z0) = 0 and f′(z0) > 0. In particulur, **every bounded, connected
set in C is holomorphic to the unit disk.**

***Weierstrass Preparation Theorem:*** For some analytic function in the complex plane and a point P, up to multiplication by a function not zero at P, 
a polynomial in one fixed variable z, which is monic, and whose coefficients of lower degree terms are analytic functions in the remaining variables and zero at P.

***Mobius Transformation:*** (Intuitively) obtained by first performing stereographic projection from the plane to the unit two-sphere, rotating and moving the sphere to a new location and orientation in space, and then performing stereographic projection (from the new position of the sphere) to the plane

***Uniformization Theorem:*** (generalized mapping theorem) every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of three Riemann surfaces: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere.

***(Cauchy) Argument Prinicple***: if f(z) is a meromorphic function inside and on some closed contour C, and f has no zeros or poles on C, then

$$
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{C} {f'(z) \over f(z)}\, dz=Z-P
$$

where Z and P denote respectively the number of zeros and poles of f(z) inside the contour C, with each zero and pole counted as many times as its multiplicity and order, respectively, indicate.
